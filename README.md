# HK-Rainfall-Data-fetching
Fetching the Data of Hong Kong Rainfall from Hong Kong Observatory (https://www.hko.gov.hk/), I am using Excel VBA to fetch such data in a fast and easy way.

Usage limitation: 
1. It only can fetch the data from pass 365 Day. For example, It is 15 Dec 2017, you can only fetch the data from 16 Dec 2016 - 14 Dec 2017.
2. It only can fetch the data in the monthly period, you can't fetch the data only for 1 day.
3. It only can fetch the data for one rainfall record location each time.


By inputing the Year, and selecting the month and Region of the rainfall record location that you want to fetch the data, and then submit. It will spend some time to fetch the data from HKO server, and the fetched data would be list in the spreadsheet in the daily 24 Hours' rainfall format.

I am welcome to receive any comment and collaboration to revise and improve it.
